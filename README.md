# Workshop-0

Link: [https://whosaidthat-3636.github.io/Workshop-0/]
In this workshop, the idea is the experiment with different variables, conditions and increments through 2D primitives

## Tasks
* Create a p5.js editorLinks to an external site. login and sign up to the Processing Foundation's forumLinks to an external site
* Make a p5.js sketch using 2D primitive shapes, variables, and conditionals. Make sure to save your work.
* Experiment with at least one of the following 2D primitive shapes from the p5.js documentation: line, triangle, quad, arc.
* Keep notes to clearly document your process and learning.

### 1. Writing 2D Primitive Shapes
- Lines
  ```
  stroke(0);
  strokeWeight(5);
  line(250, 15, 400, 15);
  line(150, 90, 400, 20);
  line(180, 150, 400, 60);
  ```
- Arc
  ```
  noStroke();
  fill(204, 204, 255);
  arc(x, 280, 100, 100, 0, PI + HALF_PI);
  ```
- Triangle
  ```
  noStroke(0);
  fill(153, 204, 244);
  triangle(15, 25, 155, 10, 30, 250);
  ```
- Rectangle
  ```
  stroke(255);
  fill(255, 255, 153);
  rect(250, 100, 100, 200);
  ```
